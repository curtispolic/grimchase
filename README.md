# grimchase

Planned engine for an ARPG with various, undecided mechanics and features!

Todo:
- Combat (make enemies fight back)
- Skilling (i.e Runescape mining)
- Loot / Inventory
- Spells
- Merchants
- Improve Map Generation
    - Level types
    - Special event rooms

Notes:
- Maintain VERY rudimentary loot to begin with
- Map overlay or a minimap would be useful
- Consider fog of war
    - Lighting can be done by the colour field in a Draw() call

Known Bugs:
- Doors can be generated at a wall "T"
- Pathfinding for small movements can be a bit dodgy
