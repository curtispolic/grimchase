# grimchase

Planned engine for an ARPG with various, undecided mechanics and features!

Todo:
- Wall collisions
- Random map generation
- Pathfinding
- Enemies to battle
- Loot / Inventory
- Spells
- Mana / HP
- Merchants

Notes:
- Maintain VERY rudimentary loot to begin with
- Pathfinding should be A*
- Map overlay or a minimap would be useful
- Consider fog of war
